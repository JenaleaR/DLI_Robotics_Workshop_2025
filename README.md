## 🎯 You’ll learn

### Pose estimation fundamentals

* 🧩 What keypoints, skeletons, and confidence scores mean in practice
* 👥 Single-person detection basics 
* 📈 How to think about simple quality checks (e.g., % of keypoints detected, stability over time)

### Hands-on in Colab

* ⚙️ Environment setup and troubleshooting in Colab
* 🖼️ Running inference on images/video and overlaying skeletons 
* 🧵 Robot decision-making

### From pixels to robot-useful signals

* 🎛️ Mapping keypoints to interpretable features (angles, distances, simple poses)
* 🔁 A tiny state-machine pattern: “if gesture → do behavior,” with guard rails

## 🎬 Pre-workshop demo: Pepper @ CMU-Africa (CSSR4Africa)

We’ll kick off with a short demo inspired by **Culturally Sensitive Social Robotics for Africa (CSSR4Africa)** - showcasing how **verbal and non-verbal cultural norms** can be encoded to make social robot interactions more natural on the continent.

  [2nd Workshop Website](https://sites.google.com/view/robotlearning4africa-2024)
  In a collaboration with Scaleup Robotics AB, the session enabled participants to program live robot arms located in Sweden. This practical tutorial explored the fundamentals and applications of cloud robotics and cutting‑edge techniques in robotic manipulation.
  


* **Robot Learning for Africa Workshop — DLI 2023 (Accra, Ghana)**

  [1st Workshop Website](https://sites.google.com/view/robotlearning4africa)
  The hands-on demo focused on Getting Started with Imitation Learning using a 6‑DOF (cobot) robot arm. Participants were guided to train a Behaviour Cloning policy using provided demonstration data, and then encouraged to collect additional simulation data in PyBullet to further improve the policy’s performance.
